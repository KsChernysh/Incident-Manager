Incident Management Web API
The Incident Management Web API is designed to streamline the process of managing incidents, accounts, and contacts within an organization. The primary goal of this project is to provide a robust system that allows users to efficiently create and manage records of incidents while ensuring proper linkage to accounts and contacts.

Key Features:
Incident Management: Users can create incidents associated with specific accounts, enabling a clear understanding of issues and their resolutions.
Account and Contact Integration: The API ensures that accounts are always linked to contacts, maintaining accurate records and fostering effective communication.
Data Validation: The system includes checks to prevent duplicate contacts and ensures that accounts cannot be created without an existing contact.

Use Case:
The API is particularly useful for organizations that need to track incidents related to customer accounts. By linking incidents to both accounts and contacts, businesses can maintain comprehensive records, ensuring that all relevant information is readily accessible and up-to-date.
